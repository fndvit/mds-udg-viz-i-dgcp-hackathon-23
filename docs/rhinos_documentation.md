# From data to action
*Team Rhino: Isaac, Wilber, Samuel, Feng, Judit*

We want to sketch out the lifecycle of a **metric about the impact of air pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) on human health (as years of life expectancy loss)**, based on **publicly-available open data** and use it to inform the public about the risks of air pollution and enable policy-makers to make regulatory decisions based on evidence.


## Objectius
Prototype an interactive, country-level report about the impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution ‚Äîto be used by policy-makers
### Sub-objectives
