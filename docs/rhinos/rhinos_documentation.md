# From data to action
*Team Rhino: Isaac, Wilber, Samuel, Feng, Judit*

We want to sketch out the lifecycle of a **metric about the impact of air pollution (PM<sub>2.5</sub>) on human health (as years of life expectancy loss)**, based on **publicly-available open data** and use it to inform the public about the risks of air pollution and enable policy-makers to make regulatory decisions based on evidence.


## Objectius
Prototype an interactive, country-level report about the impact of PM<sub>2.5</sub> pollution ‚Äîto be used by policy-makers

## Metodologia
Waterfall

## Cicle de vida 
12h
1. Brainstorming 
2. Design Story
3. Search of fake data
4. Implementation of the plots with fake data
5. Use the real data 
6. Document observable notebook + powerpoint presentation


## Entregables
* Brief summary of the methodology used by the pandas üêº and the rhinos ü¶è
* A criteria to determine country hotspots
* ObservableHQ notebook with the prototype that helps policy-makers simulate different pollution-reduction scenarios
